# Database Maintenance Project

Welcome to my SQL Scripts Repository for Database Maintenance! In this collection, I showcase various SQL scripts I've used for performing essential database maintenance tasks. These scripts include operations like archiving old data, reorganizing indexes, updating statistics, and other optimization techniques that help ensure the smooth performance of a database.

## Overview
The Database Maintenance Project focuses on maintaining a healthy database by performing various maintenance tasks. It includes a SQL script that automates operations such as archiving old data, reorganizing indexes, updating statistics, shrinking database files, and more.

## Project Structure
- `maintenance_script.sql`: SQL script containing the maintenance operations.

## Maintenance Script
The maintenance script (`maintenance_script.sql`) is a SQL script designed to handle various database maintenance tasks. It includes operations such as archiving old data, reorganizing indexes, updating statistics, shrinking database files, checking integrity, and logging maintenance activities.

## Features
- **Archiving Old Data:** Move and archive records older than a specified timeframe.
- **Index Reorganization:** Optimize index performance by reorganizing them.
- **Statistics Update:** Keep the query optimizer informed by updating table statistics.
- **Database Shrinking:** Free up unused space by shrinking database files.
- **Transaction Log Management:** Backup and truncate the transaction log to manage its size.
- **Integrity Checks:** Ensure the integrity of all tables in the database.
- **Logging:** Log maintenance activities, including completion timestamps and types.

## How to Use
1. Open the `maintenance_script.sql` script in your SQL editor of choice. (Use at own risk)
2. View each section of the file and read the description and "How to use" to understand the function of the script
