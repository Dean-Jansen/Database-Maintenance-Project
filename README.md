# Database Maintenance Project

Welcome to my Database Maintenance Project repository! In this project, I showcase my skills by creating a complex and creative SQL script for performing various database maintenance tasks. The script includes operations such as archiving old data, reorganizing indexes, updating statistics, and more.

## Overview
The Database Maintenance Project focuses on maintaining a healthy database by performing various maintenance tasks. It includes a SQL script that automates operations such as archiving old data, reorganizing indexes, updating statistics, shrinking database files, and more.

## Project Structure
- `maintenance_script.sql`: SQL script containing the complex maintenance operations.

## Maintenance Script
The maintenance script (`maintenance_script.sql`) is a complex SQL script designed to handle various database maintenance tasks. It includes operations such as archiving old data, reorganizing indexes, updating statistics, shrinking database files, checking integrity, and logging maintenance activities.

## Features
- **Archiving Old Data:** Move and archive records older than a specified timeframe.
- **Index Reorganization:** Optimize index performance by reorganizing them.
- **Statistics Update:** Keep the query optimizer informed by updating table statistics.
- **Database Shrinking:** Free up unused space by shrinking database files.
- **Transaction Log Management:** Backup and truncate the transaction log to manage its size.
- **Integrity Checks:** Ensure the integrity of all tables in the database.
- **Logging:** Log maintenance activities, including completion timestamps and types.

## How to Use
1. Execute the `maintenance_script.sql` script in your database management tool. (Use at own risk)
2. Customize script parameters such as archive timeframe, database name, and file paths as needed.
